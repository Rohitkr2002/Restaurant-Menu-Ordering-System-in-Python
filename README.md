# Restaurant-Menu-Ordering-System-in-Python
This project is a simple console-based application developed in Python that allows users to order food items from a predefined menu. The system presents a list of available items along with their prices and prompts the user to enter their desired selection. If the item is available, it is added to the order, and the total amount is calculated. The user can also choose to add another item. The program ensures user-friendly interaction by handling input validation, informing users when an item is unavailable, and providing the total cost at the end of the order.

Key Features:

    Predefined menu with items and corresponding prices
    Input validation for item selection
    Option to add multiple items to the order
    Real-time order total calculation
    User-friendly console interface

This project helps reinforce concepts such as conditional statements, input handling, and working with dictionaries in Python.
